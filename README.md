# What is it ?
This repository contains c++ implementaion of Linked List, Simple list, Map and String. 
# Why ?
To provide highly portable libraries that will work on most of popular platforms + embedded devices that don't have enough flash to use stdc++ library. 
# How to use it ?
Include files into your project by copy pasting, build library or do whatever suits your needs.
# ToDo:
It is stable and should not contain any memory leaks and obvious problems but...

# Tests
Respository contains few simple tests in tests.cpp created mostly to make sure that there are no memory leaks.
